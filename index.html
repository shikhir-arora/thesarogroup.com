                <p>
                    Adapting technology in profound ways is not a simple task. That is why we spend a tremendous time on
                    <em>research and development</em> above all else. We uniquely examine a multitude of fields to produce work in many disciplines. Careful attention to detail and modernity are key to our work. It is important to build for
                    the future - laying the groundwork for designs that will remain strong for years to come. By looking at the entire picture - from the mathematics that power algorithms to the final user experience itself - we can design
                    with confidence and determination. The results bring together diverse sectors in seamless yet powerful ways.

                <h2>Case Study - Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is the blanket term used to describe how computational power is utilized to process and learn about data. We are interested in processing such raw data to develop strong observations. Combining the power
                    of statistical methods as well as a natural iterative approach allows data to be visualized in intuitive ways. Machine Learning and adaptive technologies are vital in our developments which aim to powerfully simplify the
                    experiences of user-driven tasks and modeling that were previously out of reach.

                <h2>Case Study - Cryptography</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptography is a vast field that comprises the science and methods of developing secure communication between multiple parties assuming that an adversary is present. We have been very focused on cryptography and
                    consider it to be a defining part of our company. Strong security is becoming paramount in the world today, and large networks are implementing stronger protocols every day that aim to accomplish the goals of privacy in
                    communication. With Quantum Computing and other technological hurdles, Cryptography is constantly evolving. Our work is focused on presenting <em>inherent</em> & decentralized anonymity on top of the strongest existing
                    standards of encryption utilized today - however we are also constantly researching algorithms that are resistant to the standard Quantum-based attacks (such as Lattice-based methods) to build for the future. Overall,
                    our research in cryptographic methods remains a key part of our work as well as our interest in providing transparent, open and mathematically (<em>proven</em>) strong security for years to come.

                <h2>Case Study - Signal Processing</h2>
                <p>
                    Signal processing is another core part of our research. Our focus is on audiovisual signals and the engineering behind audio (sound) and visual (lighting) are both part of the vast field of signal processing. The goal of
                    signal processing in the audiovisual domain is to analyze these sources and resultant protocols to improve methods of higher fidelity and new innovations in automation. We are interested in <u>all(!)</u> things audio had
                    us unlimited time, but our research is primarily focused on the mathematics behind components and protocols such as Digital-to-Analog converters (DACs) and the DMX protocol for fixture control (mainly lighting). By
                    studying the engineering of audio conversion from digital sources to analogue soundwaves combined with psychoacoustics (the psychological study of sound perception), we can utilize newer (or previously very
                    computationally expensive) methods to improve as technology continues to advance. More and more extremely powerful source components such as FPGA are growing in the field - all the while becoming more accessible to end
                    users with advanced modern software. Furthermore, we are interested in automation algorithms and variations of standard Fourier transform-based real-time visualization of audio to lighting with the same powerful hardware
                    that continues to grow in scope. We can additionally utilize our other research and development such as <em>Machine Learning</em> to further advance algorithms for automation and other tasks in signal processing.
